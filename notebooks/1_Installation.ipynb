    "**terminal**: A text-entry method of controlling your computer. We use this to run python programs, because a .py file isn't like an executable (.exe) you can just double-click on and run. Well it can be, but that's for another day.\n",
    "   - If you use a Windows computer, I suggest you use [PowerShell](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell) as your terminal.\n",
    "   - If you use macOS, I suggest you use [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/) as your terminal.\n",
    "   - If you use Linux, you don't need my advice.\n",
    "   \n",
    "**Python**: The best language to program in, in my naive opinion. It is not a compiled language, meaning you don't need to know anything fancy to run it, other than typing `python program.py` into your *terminal*.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Anaconda**: a huge `.exe` file you can download from [here](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/), which contains *Python*, but also every library that you might ever find useful for data-science work.\n",
    "\n",
    "**conda**: a *Python* program you run from your *terminal*, which installs packages for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "**pip**: Same as conda, but harder to use and covering a broader set of packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "**git**: A way of saving off versions of your code over time. Integrated into [github](https://github.com), which allows for public sharing of really anything, but usually code (WARNING: also an instant trigger word for Brian Cadman)."
