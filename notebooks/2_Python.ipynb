    "Documentation: https://docs.python.org/3/reference/index.html\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we know the basics of data in Python, it's time to move to the logic of programming.\n",
    "I don't expect to teach you that here, this is just the syntax behind the typical logical components you would expect.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing to know is about whitespace.\n",
    "Python defines 'blocks' by whitespace (tabs or spaces).\n",
    "This means where C would say:\n",
    "\n",
    "```c\n",
    "if (x > 5) {\n",
    "    sprintf(\"String\");\n",
    "}\n",
    "sprintf(\"Always prints\");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Python's version would read:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if x > 5:\n",
    "    print(\"String)\n",
    "print(\"Always prints\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note two things:\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. Python doesn't use {} to denote what belongs to the `if` statement (i.e. what will run if True), it uses the indent. To 'end' the block, just don't indent the code.\n",
    "  2. Python doesn't use ; to end a command. Python assumes one command per line, which you can extend with `()` or `\\` (like we saw above in strings):"
